# CI/CD Data Pipeline Challenge üöÄ

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to a CI/CD challenge in analytical architecture, focusing on building a robust and automated data ingestion pipeline. The goal is to develop a data ingestion platform in a development environment and establish a deployment process to move pipelines to production efficiently.

## Key Objectives

- Automated Data Pipeline Deployment: Set up CI/CD workflows to deploy ingestion pipelines.

- Reliable Data Processing: Ensure clean and structured data flows into analytical environments.

- Unit Testing with Pytest: Implement automated tests to validate pipeline transformations.

## Technology Stack

- Programming Language: Python üêç

- Testing Framework: Pytest 

- CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions

- Containerization: Docker

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cicd-data-pipeline.git
cd cicd-data-pipeline
```
2. Set Up Virtual Environment & Dependencies:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Running Unit Tests:

Run tests to validate transformations and pipeline integrity:
```
pytest tests/
```
4. Push changes to trigger the CI/CD workflow and deploy the pipeline:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Deploying ingestion pipeline"
git push origin main
```
